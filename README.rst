libsoxrate
==========

What is this?
-------------
Win32 DLL based on rate converter of SoX (http://sox.sourceforge.net/).

Difference from libsox are:
  - Only contains rate converter.
  - Not a static link lib.
  - Different API.
  - Using Win32 native threads for parallelizing.
  - Eliminated needs of synchronization for global cache in the original code.

However, basically it's nothing but sox rate converter.
